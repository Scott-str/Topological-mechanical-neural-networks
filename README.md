# Topological-mechanical-neural-networks
We introduce the mechanical analogue of in situ backpropagation to enable highly efficient training of wave-based mechanical neural networks. With the exact gradient information, we showcase the successful training of TMNNs for binary classification tasks, achieving high accuracy.
## Setup
The codes were developed in Matlab 2023a on Windows. Install Time of Matlab depends on your computer. Download the files and run Learningspring2D.m. Each task may take a few minutes to run depending on your computer.<br />
Feel free to adjust the parameters such as input nodes, output nodes, learning rate, and define your desired configuration of the TMNNs. Also feel free to change the amplitude encoding to phase encoding and hybrid encoding by yourself.
## Examples
We demonstrate the Iris flower classification task (built-in dataset). The inputs are four harmonic forces applied on two nodes horizontally and vertically from features of Iris flower using amplitude encoding. The Iris flower is classified based on the excited pseudospin wave propagation.
